# *Faithful Edit by Mickman*
Ever since Vattic stopped developing their Faithful Resource Pack, tons of different versions and textures started flying around. Some looked "Faithful-ish" and others looked nothing like the original. Since 1.13, with every Minecraft update, I've been combining some of my favorite textures into a conglomerate pack, which I see as the most appealing pack compared to others.
